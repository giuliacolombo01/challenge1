Readme is a bit poor.
  - Use sections to divide several information:
      - what your code is about
      - how to compile your code
      - how to run some tests

Also, I don't see many commits from the github...

Please instead of telling the user where to modify the lines of code, parametrize the input..

Makefile: 
      - in your makefile you are including a non-existing folder.
      - If you are using C++ use CXX instead of CC for the compiler

Code Design:
  code should have had its own classes, or everything should be on one file (discouraged anyway). For sure, not a mix, where you have a Point.hpp and many functions inside the main.cpp.
  - the pow method should be changed when evaluating integer powers since they are very slow.
  - no getpot, nor json, nor muparser.
